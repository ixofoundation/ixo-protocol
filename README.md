# IXO Protocol

Welcome to the IXO Protocol repository! This repository provides the technical specifications, semantic definitions, and sample artifacts for creating decentralized digital domains using the IXO Spatial Web Platform. The IXO Protocol is a versatile toolset designed to enable trusted, verifiable interactions and data management for any type of digital entity, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), fungible tokens, tokenized namespace records, and other Spatial Web entities.

## Overview

The IXO Protocol is at the core of building a decentralized Spatial Web, a new generation of the internet designed for verifiable interactions with digital entities. Using blockchain technology, the IXO Spatial Web Platform provides the technical foundation for identifying, managing, and interacting with digital twin representations of both tangible and abstract entities. These entities can range from real-world physical objects to complex cognitive digital twin systems, all integrated into a unified, verifiable framework.

The IXO Spatial Web Platform enables seamless interaction between decentralized applications, agents, and digital twins, establishing trust and data integrity across digital domains.

## Features

- **Decentralized Digital Domains**: Establishes unique, identifiable namespaces for all types of digital entities, including digital twins of real-world and virtual entities.
- **Verifiable Records**: Ensures trusted, immutable records for any type of interaction or transaction involving Spatial Web entities.
- **Interoperable Standards**: Leverages existing Web (W3C, IETF) and blockchain protocols for compatibility across various networks, enhancing interoperability within the decentralized Web 3.0 ecosystem.
- **Smart Contracts and Executable Workflows**: Facilitates programmable, verifiable workflows for managing Spatial Web entities, making the platform adaptable to a wide range of use cases.
